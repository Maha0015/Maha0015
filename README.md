## Featured Research & Projects

### Bioinformatic Analysis of Nova-Regulated Alternative Splicing in Ciona robusta
Investigating Nova/Ebf-mediated splicing in **Ciona robusta** to identify alternative splicing events in key neuromuscular junction genes. I streamlined genomic analysis using STAR and IGV to characterize unannotated isoforms in claudin-h and claudin-k across multiple developmental stages. This work integrates CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockouts with custom Sashimi plots to validate splicing shifts and transcriptomic changes.

### Protein Function Prediction using pLM Embeddings
Developed a novel computational pipeline leveraging **ESM-C protein language model embeddings** and a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) for remote homology detection. The model, validated on ProteinShake and CATH datasets, outperforms traditional sequence alignment methods. I utilized T-SNE to visualize high-dimensional embeddings, demonstrating clear, functionally relevant separations of distinct protein topologies.
Variant Calling Workflow: Automated Bash-based pipeline for SAM/BAM validation and functional consequence analysis using 1000 Genomes datasets for sickle cell and CFTR mutations.

### Variant Calling & Consequences Pipeline
Implemented workflow for processing 1000 Genomes VCF datasets. The pipeline automates SAM/BAM validation, sorting, and quality control. I applied this workflow to investigate sickle cell and CFTR mutations, quantifying variant frequencies globally and interpreting functional consequences using BCFtools and custom Python scripts to link genotypes to phenotypic outcomes.

### Simple Airline Management System (SAMS) Database
Designed and implemented a relational database system for airline operations using MySQL Workbench. The project involved creating complex stored procedures, views, and functions to manage real-time data flow between airplanes, pilots, and passengers, ensuring strict data integrity and supporting operational monitoring.
