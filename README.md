## Hi there 👋
Hi, I'm Mahalakshmi Rajan! 👋

🧬 Bioinformatics Graduate Student @ Georgia Tech

I am a Master’s student in Bioinformatics at the Georgia Institute of Technology with hands-on experience in genomic data analysis, alternative splicing, and functional genomics. I focus on building and deploying computational pipelines and machine learning models to derive meaningful biological insights from complex datasets.

🛠 Technical Skills

Languages & Databases: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, PyTorch), R (tidyverse, Bioconductor, DESeq2), Bash, Linux, MySQL.

Bioinformatics Analysis: STAR, IGV, SAMtools, BCFtools, DESeq2, Minimap2, BLAST, Plink2, Galaxy, fastp, FastQC.

Data Science & ML: ESM-C Protein Language Models (pLM), Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP), T-SNE Visualization.

Laboratory Expertise: CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockouts, Microbial & Cell Culture, RNA Integrity Validation (Gel Electrophoresis).

Protein Modeling: Pymol, PyRx, SWISS-DOCK.

🔬 Featured Research & Projects

Ciona Splicing Analysis: Investigating Nova/Ebf-mediated splicing and characterizing claudin-h/k isoforms using custom Sashimi plots. Achieved 95% accuracy in small exon detection and identified unannotated isoforms.

Protein Function Prediction: Developing computational pipelines leveraging ESM-C protein language model embeddings and MLP for remote homology detection, surpassing traditional sequence alignment methods.

Variant Calling Workflow: Automated Bash-based pipeline for SAM/BAM validation and functional consequence analysis using 1000 Genomes datasets for sickle cell and CFTR mutations.

SAMS Database Design: Implementation of a relational database for a Simple Airline Management System using MySQL Workbench.
